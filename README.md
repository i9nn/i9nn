Hi! I'm Ian. I hate everyone and everything.

I know a variety of langauges and am hoping to learn tons more. Some of my favorites include
Lua, Java, C, SQL, and some other wacky ones. If you have suggestions, don't be afraid to give me some. 

Planning to pursue artificial intelligence or architecture.
